# STM32 Bluepill Board Recreation

This project documents the process of recreating an STM32 Bluepill board using Altium Designer. As a beginner, I designed my own board to learn PCB design fundamentals and practice schematic and layout skills.

## Introduction

Building a custom STM32 Bluepill board in Altium Designer gave me hands-on experience with PCB design tools, schematic capture, and board layout. This repo summarizes the main steps and lessons learned throughout the project.

## Tools Used

- **Altium Designer** – PCB design software
- **DigiKey, snapEDA** – Websites for finding parts and datasheets
- **YouTube Tutorials:** 
  - EsteemPCB Academy [STM32 Controller design with Altium 20](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhzgb9TEt7AWgrpgB9wkK_Lh85a2T4qQd) 
- **Altium Designer Documentation:** [Official Documentation](https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer)

## My Workflow

- **Find symbols:** Read datasheets and mapped pins accurately for STM32 components.
- **Find footprints:** Searched websites for footprints and 3D models.
- **Linked schematic and PCB:** Synchronizing schematic and PCB kept design changes consistent.
- **Changed design rules:** Customized clearances and trace widths for reliability.
- **Manual routing:** Routed signals by hand for practice.

## Lessons Learned

- Became more familiar with Altium Designer workflows.
- Learned to source symbols and footprints from online resources.
- Improved understanding of PCB layout and design rule customization.

I’m excited to use these skills for future embedded projects!
